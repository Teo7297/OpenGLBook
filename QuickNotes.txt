Transformations are Matrix * Vector operations.
We can do multiple at once but REMEMBER:
	- The order is reversed, right to left. The right most is the first getting multiplied by the vector.
	- We shoud do different transformations in order:
		1) Scale 		// identity matrix with values on the diagonal
		2) Rotate		// giga matrix see book
		3) Translate	// identity matrix with values on the last column
